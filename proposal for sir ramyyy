Hydrologic Anomaly Detection System (HADS)
 or 
Aqueous Intrusion Detection and Alert Module (AIDAM)

1.	Real-Time Water Level Monitoring: The device uses ultrasonic sensors or pressure transducers to continuously measure the water level and report it at regular intervals. This is a standard feature in many water monitoring systems.
2.	User-Configurable Thresholds: Users can set custom high and low water level thresholds. When the water level crosses these thresholds, the system triggers alerts (e.g., alarms, notifications). This allows for site-specific customization.
3.	Data Logging and Historical Analysis: The device stores historical water level data, which can be accessed for analysis of trends, patterns, and flood prediction modeling. This is a common feature for environmental monitoring.
4.	Remote Data Access and Control: Users can access real-time data and configure the device remotely through a web interface or mobile app. This allows for convenient monitoring and management from anywhere.
Unique Feature:
5.	Predictive Risk Assessment based on Environmental Factors: In addition to measuring water level, the device integrates data from other environmental sensors (e.g., rainfall, soil moisture, barometric pressure) and utilizes a machine learning algorithm to predict the risk of dangerous water levels in the near future (e.g., within the next 24-48 hours). This predictive capability goes beyond simply reacting to current water levels and provides proactive warnings of potential flooding events. This could be a key differentiator for your product
